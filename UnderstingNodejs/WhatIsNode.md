# What is node.js ?

### Node.js is an open source, cross-plataform, js runtime environment that executes js code outside of a web browser. It´s built upon V8 (js engine), an engine that its running in a lot of browsers including chrome, opera mini and edge, so that´s how work. We can use js code outside of a browser.

- Node has some optimizations for v8 wich apps running in a server side migth need, like buffer class that allows v8 to read files in your system, some of those makes node.js a really good choice for build smthg like a web server w node.js
